<strong>he History of the Save the Day Program</strong>
<br /><br />
In February 2003, Cornell's then-junior goaltender Kyle Miller was diagnosed with a rare form of bone cancer. Despite his doctor's prognosis that he would not play collegiate lacrosse again, Miller made a triumphant return to the Big Red, seeing action in six games during the 2005 season. During the summer of 2003, while Miller was at home undergoing treatment, Ian Rosenberger '04 and David Pittard '04 decided to do something to support their teammate. The senior class chose to raise money to help children that were faced with chronic and critical illnesses. After teaming up with the Tompkins Trust Company and The Central New York Chapter of the Dream Factory, the Cornell lacrosse team founded the Save the Day fundraising program in the spring of 2004. This year’s clinic will continue to support Cornell Lacrosse’s fundraising effort for the Dream Factory. With your help, we look forward to the opportunity to continue to create more memories of a lifetime for local kids.

					The Horseheads Youth Lacrosse Club is proud to announce our support for the Horseheads High School Boys and Girls Lacrosse Programs.
					The club has annually made a donation to the program to help them with the elimination of the JV Assistant Coach position that was eliminated due to budget cuts back in 2010.
					Many of the current high school players are former club members that have come through our program.
					We are happy to announce a donation of $500.00 to each program.
