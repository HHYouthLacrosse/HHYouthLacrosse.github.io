		Donation
	</div>

	<div class="news_contents x-grid-12">
		The Horseheads Youth Lacrosse Club is proud to announce our support for the Horseheads High School Boys and Girls Lacrosse Programs.
		The club has annually made a donation to the program to help them with the elimination of the JV Assistant Coach position that was eliminated due to budget cuts back in 2010.
		Many of the current high school players are former club members that have come through our program.
		We are happy to announce a donation of $500.00 to each program.
