		Finger Lakes Lacrosse League Rules
	</div>

	<div id="rules_text" class="x-grid-12">
		Grade levels K-2 and 3-4 play on a smaller field  and play with 2 attackmen, 3 midfielders, 2 defense and a goalie. All players play with short sticks.
		<br><br>
		Grade level 5-6 play full field and play a full lacrosse team with 3 attack, 3 middies, and 3 defense plus a goalie.
		Defensemen use long sticks. Our team has long defensive stick available. You  don't need to buy a long pole unless you want to.
		<br><br>
		All games are shorter than regulation and usually have a running clock.
		<br><br>
		One pass in the offensive end is required before shooting for grades K-2 and 3-4 age levels. There is no pass rule for 5-6.
		<br><br>
		No body contact initiated with the torso. Hip checks, boxing out, stick checks and legal holds are allowed.
		<br><br>
		No time limits on advancing the pass across the midfield or into the goal area.
		<br><br>
		At the two lower age groups penalties will be handled by removing the offending player for 1 minute and substituting another player.
		The foul will then be explained by a coach. At  the grade level 5-6 the player goes to the penalty box and we play man-up or  man-down.
